understanding of and plan for their travel expenses.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
I am interested in this project because it addresses a **real-life problem**. 
It **helps people** better manage and understand their driving costs, offering potential
economic benefits to individuals and corporations. As the cost of living continues 
to rise in Canada today, more people are concerned about their financial situation. 
This application aligns with the growing demand for economic and financial information. 
I want to contribute my time and knowledge gained from my coursework to turn this 
idea into a usable program that can benefit a wider audience.
