# DriveCostPro
#####  *"Budget Smarter, Drive Better"*
___
### What will the application do?
This application will **calculate** and **manage** the costs associated with driving. 
Users can input vehicle-related information such as:
- Vehicle name, maker, and model
- Purchase cost
- Monthly expenses
- Current mileage
- Expected mileage
- other relevant expenses


The application will then calculate the cost per kilometer 
and provide forecasts for future costs based on the input. Users can also update 
their information to reflect changing circumstances, helping them gain a better 
understanding of and plan for their travel expenses.

___
### Who will use it?
The app could use for **individual car owners**, **Commercial transportation companies**, 
and **financial planners**, etc. Individual car owners can use it to 
keep track of their car expenses and create better budgets. 
Commercial transportation companies can use it to make their fleet's costs more 
efficient and reduce operational expenses. 
Financial planners can use it to help clients plan their future driving expenses and 
long-term financial planning.
___
### Why is this project of interest to you?
I am interested in this project because it addresses a **real-life problem**. 
It **helps people** better manage and understand their driving costs, offering potential
economic benefits to individuals and corporations. As the cost of living continues 
to rise in Canada today, more people are concerned about their financial situation. 
This application aligns with the growing demand for economic and financial information. 
I want to contribute my time and knowledge gained from my coursework to turn this 
idea into a usable program that can benefit a wider audience.
